<s> THE CITY OF DUNDEE, ON THE NORTHERN BANKS OF THE FIRTH OF TAY IS OFTEN PASSED-OVER AS A PLACE TO VISIT AND ENJOY, BY BOTH HOME-GROWN AND OVERSEAS VISITORS ALIKE; DRAWING A BAD PRESS FROM THE FORMER AND A GENERALLY IGNORED BY THE LATTER. YET, LOOKING BEYOND ITS LESS GLAMOROUS ARCHITECTURE, AND A DODGY ‘80S REPUTATION THAT IT FINDS HARD TO SHIFT, DUNDEE HAS AN INCREDIBLE HISTORY, AND SOME FANTASTIC PLACES TO VISIT. IT’S WELL WORTH THE SECOND GLANCE, AND INDEED A SECOND CHANCE. </s>
