The City of Dundee, on the northern banks of the Firth of Tay is often passed-over as a place to visit and enjoy, by both home-grown and overseas visitors alike; drawing a bad press from the former and a generally ignored by the latter. Yet, looking beyond its less glamorous architecture, and a dodgy ‘80s reputation that it finds hard to shift, Dundee has an incredible history, and some fantastic places to visit. It’s well worth the second glance, and indeed a second chance.
